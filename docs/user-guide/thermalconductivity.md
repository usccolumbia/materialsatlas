## Manual

### Background

Thermal conductivity is a materials property representing how heat is transferred from one side of a material to the other when thermal energy is applied. It is an important physical quantity in terms of many applications for better thermal management to ensure the performance, life-time, and safety for thermoelectric energy conversion devices, and spintronics technology. Thermal conductivity are controlled by both electron and lattice (phonon) contributions. Currently, first principles based DFT calculations can be used to compute the thermal conductivity for crystal materials, but it is slow or even not feasible for materials with large number of atoms within the unit cell. A variety of machine learning models have been developed with both composition and structural desriptors for thermal conductivity prediction as reviewed in [^1]. However, the key challenge of thermal conductivity prediction is the limited number labelled data samples. Quite a few studies have used from 80 to <200 labelled samples and demonstrated good (over-estimated) performance, which only interploate well within their highly redundant data set. Here we trained  composition based and structure based (using graph neural networks) thermal prediction models using a dataset with ~2700 samples [^2] with calculated thermal conductivity. A dataset with 872 experimentally determined LTC values are also available at [^6].


### The LTC Prediction methods



#### The composition based LTC prediction model

Our composition model is trained using the Magpie descriptors from the Matminer package [^3] together with the Roost neural network model [^4]. 

#### The deep graph neural network model for LTC prediction

Our structure based LTC prediction model is based on our latest work of DeeperGATGNN algorithm [^5], which is a scalable deep graph neural network model with the state-of-the-art performance for structure based materials property prediction. 

### Performance and Limitations

The MAE of our composition ML model on the hold-out test set is 5.09. <br>
The MAE of our structure ML model on the hold-out test set is 4.22. 

### Using the LTC Predictor

#### Entering Inputs

Practically, the procedure for getting predictions consists in 3 steps

1. Input a material formula or a csv with a list of formulas. It will automatically use the composition machine learning model. You can also upload a structure cif file, it will select the graph neural network model accordingly. 

2. click "predict now"

3. collect the result or download the results csv file.



#### Interpreting the Results




### Future features

In the future, we want to further improve the performance of our model using transfer learning and semi-supervised learning.
